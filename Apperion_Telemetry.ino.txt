**THIS WRITE-UP REFERS TO THE PRE-EXISTING ITERATION OF THE TELEMETRY SYSTEM (1.0)**

Summary:  The main sketch file of Apperion Telemetry. Utilizing MCP_Can library to read
	  information from devices on CAN network and stores those values on SD Shield.
	  While simultaneously writing to Genie display and transmitting to XBee shield.

Includes: telem_library.h

Methods:  setup(): Template hook for Arduino setup.  Setup initializes the serial, the Genie component,
		   the XBee, the CAN bus, and the SD shield.

	  loop(): Template hook for Arduino loop.  Sends a motor controller request message, read in 
		  messages on the CAN bus, interpret the incoming data, calculate appropriate values,
		  write values to the SD card, and send the data to the Genie shield.

	  sendToScreen(): Writes calculated values to the Genie screen.

	  init_variables(): Initializes variables to ensure that we're not reading 'garbage' data.

	  interpretMessages(unsigned char canID, uint8_t buf[]): Interprets values of messages received via CAN.
			   @param canId: the identifier of the can message received
			   @param buf[]: the message buffer of the message received

	  updateAuxilaryBatteryVoltage(): Updates the voltage of the auxiliary battery and output high when the
					  voltage drops below the defined voltage threshold.

	  updateNetCurrentAndPower(): Updates the net current and power values.  Should be called whenever battery current, 
				      instantaneous voltage, battery power, array total current, or array total power.

	  updateArrayTotals(): Updates the total and pwer coming from all subarrays.  Should be called every time a subarray
				message is receieved.

	  updateStateOfCharge(): Updates the state of charge depending on instantaneous voltage.  Should be called whenever 
				 instantenous voltage is updated.

	  updateMotorSpeed(): Updates the speed of the motor is MPH. Should be called every time motor RPM is updated.

	  updateSubArrayValues(uint8_t arrayNumber, uint8_t buf[]): Updates the sub array values for a specific array, after a CAN
								    message is recieved from that subarray.
